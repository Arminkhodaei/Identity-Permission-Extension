# Contribution Guidelines

Hi there, and thanks for your interest in the ASP.NET Identity Permission Extension repository. This document serves as a set of general guidelines for open-source contribution.

## Communication and Issues:

Whether you want to report a bug or an enhancement please make sure you check out the issues. If you are sure that what you want to contribute is new, then please open an issue describing what you want to accomplish before you decide to commit any code. This will guarantee no one else will work on the same file(s) you are working on.

## NuGet and 3rd Party Libraries:

If your implementation depends on a 3rd party library, and you think it is critical, then please communicate this before you change the solution/projects references.

In all cases, you should not commit the installed 3rd party libraries into the project. The README document will provide all the steps anyone would need to compile the library on their machine.

## Submitting Your Changes

After you commit your code, please submit your changes with a pull-request, you can do this on GitHub or through git. Make sure you provide a description message of your work with the pull-request.
